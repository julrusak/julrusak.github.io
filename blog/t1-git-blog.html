  <h1>Git and GitHub</h1>
  <h2>What is it and why should you use it?</h2>

      Git is a version control software that helps developers keep track of changes made to their code. Git is installed on your computer and uses various commands to help developers implement a more efficient workflow. You may be asking <i>What is version control?</i> Version control allows developers the chance to better collaborate and to save work in stages. Remember back to high school or college when you had to write a paper. If you simply hit 'save' you were left with just the updated edits to your paper. Maybe you used 'save as' and created new files of each iteration, using the date to distignuish one from the next. Git does this for you by using commits! Everytime you edit and commit a file, git stores a snapshot of the updated file. If the changes you made don't work, simply return to a previous commit.

        Now imagine you were collaborating on this paper with a classmate and you each decided to write the opening paragaph and see which one best suits the needs of the paper. This is where GitHub comes in. GitHub is a website where you can upload and download files to collaborate with other developers. Since git and your files live locally on your own computer, GitHub allows you to push your files to a website where others can view your work and contribute to your project. This is quite helpful if you were working on this paper with the whole class, don't you think?

        Finally, imagine you were assigned to collaborate with your class on a paper for every class in which you were enrolled. That sounds like a recipe for a mess. Not with GitHub! You can seperate your projects into different repositories, or directories, where multiple files can live. This way, anyone you are collaborating with can pull those files and work only on that project. GitHub opens up a world of potential, so check it out!
