   <h4>“These are my nine weeks! Get out of my way!”</h4>
    <p>
      After watching the Fireside Chat with Dev Bootcamp co-founder Shereef Bishay, many of my thoughts on this journey were confirmed. I control my destiny. I will get out what I put in. I am not an imposter. My impression of DBC when I visited the NYC site was that the 19 weeks will be challenging. There is a vast amount of information and the expectations are high, as they should be. I knew that juggling the program with the rest of my responsibilities would be difficult and I expected to spend any free time I had learning something new or solidifying a previous lesson, which is exactly what has happened during my very first week. My weekends are now precious time to sit at my desk for hours, working on challenges, googling solutions, and celebrating some serious tiny successes.

  <h4>“If you can’t expose your ignorance, you won’t learn.”</h4>
    <p>
      DBC is passionate about Empathetic Engineering and so am I. This was high on my list of attractive traits when applying to DBC. I am ignorant. I do not know a lot about computers or coding and I am happy to admit that. I am happy that DBC fosters an environment where saying I don’t know is a great and necessary thing. I feel like I will thrive at DBC. I love learning and I love teaching others. I feel that working on projects rather than sitting at a desk all day is much more beneficial for a student. As a student, I hope to learn from others in my cohort, I hope to teach someone in my cohort, and I hope to write some beautiful code to make some beautiful things. My expectations of DBC have not changed now that I have begun. I set my own bar high, they set the bar high, so now I’m doing my best to stay up here at this high bar.

 <h4>“Intelligence, as we think about it, is overrated”</h4>
    <p>
      I am beyond excited to participate in DBC’s learning environment. Full disclosure; I had tears in my eyes after my interview. I was humbled. I thought I was beyond prepared and I was hit with a logic question that I did not answer. In fact, I didn’t get a lot of questions right, but I remained dedicated to finding an answer, I remained positive even when I ran out of time and I showed my ignorance. I asked for help. I was vulnerable. I am vulnerable. I was never the smartest in my class and I don’t need to be. I am not nervous about learning at DBC, I am excited and I know that I am as prepared as I can be. I know that being prepared does not mean I will not fail. Being prepared means I will learn from my failures.
