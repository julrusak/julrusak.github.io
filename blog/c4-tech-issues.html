  <h1>Looking at the Tech Community</h1>
  <h2> Women in Tech.</h2>
  <h4>July 11, 2015</h4>

  <section>

        In 2013, women made up 25% of the workforce in computer occupations. Not surprising, considering that the tech field has been dominated by men. There are many reasons why women are still climbing uphill, not just in the tech field, but in the workforce in general. I'm sure you've heard about the gender wage gap, women earning 78 cents for every dollar a man earns. So there's a lot for women to overcome and, being a woman, I'm happy to be a part of the current shifting of the tides.

        A simple google search will yield multiple results if you're searching for an organization for women in technology fields. On the popular website <a href="http://www.meetup.com"> Meetup </a> you can find numerous groups just for women. I've attended some wonderful and supportive all-women workshops for Ruby on Rails and Django. In these workshops, it has been refreshing to hear from women currently in the tech community that they shared the same fears I have and that they are now working in supportive and progressive orgnizations.

        While my experience has been a positive one and the women I have met at events have shared this positive feeling, I can only speak of the community in New York City. When looking at a chart detailing the best cities for women in tech, New York is fifth, with Washington D.C. topping the list. While it's not ideal for women to relocate for employment possibilities, it is a reality for both sexes and not just in tech. Artists flock to major cities all over the country, which is how I found myself in the Big Apple.

        Women are on the move and we're fighting hard to make our mark, but with major companies like Google and Airbnb on a quest to hire more women, that fight is becomming easier.
