  <h1>Exploring Conflict</h1>
  <h2>Stop, Observe, Assess, Respond!</h2>
  <h4>August 8, 2015</h4>

      I've worked for an amazing Community Building Organization for the last four years where we provide New York City public schools with various arts education, among many other services. Each year in our training we discuss how to SOAR. Stop, Observe, Assess, Respond. This is the opposite of reacting to a student who may be acting out or behaving in a negative way. We are trained to observe this student's behavior and to ask questions that will lead the student to a clam state. We are trained to assess why this student may be acting out; did this student just go through a major life change? A death in the family? A loss of housing? Has this student had food today? This week? This acronym has helped me tremendously as a teacher and I do my best to use  this technique throughout my daily life. It isn't always easy, sometimes I still react, but the more you put it into practice, the easier it will be to follow.

      The relationship I try my hardest to soar in is definitely my marriage. Any long-term relationship will battle conflict, and my husband and I are no different, but we don't fight ever (I know, I know) because we focus on understanding where the other person is coming from and how we would feel in the others' shoes. I don't have to wonder if my husband ate that day (as I love cooking breakfast) or if he is having a hard time at home, but when conflict hits I wonder what this means to him and what are the possible outcomes of the conflict. Even something as simple and 'stupid' as leaving my clutter on the table. My husband asked me one day if I could not leave my random mail and junk on the kitchen table. I reacted. He leaves his shoes next to the bed so I pointed to them and said "When you start putting your shoes away." He rightfully felt hurt. I was clearly not happy about the shoes for some time and never said anything. I let it build up. So when he asked me to change my behavior, instead of listening and starting a dialogue, I fired shots.

      Luckily, my husband is the most amazing man and let me respond again and this time soar. I took a moment and considered what my clutter on the table meant to him. When I want to sit and eat, I know exactly where my stuff belongs. When he wants to sit and eat, he doesn't know what to do with my belongings. I don't like his shoes next to the bed because sometimes I trip on them. So, I observed both of our behavior and promised to make a change. In return, I asked that he do his best to at least put his shoes under the bed. I set up a separate place for my clutter and junk mail and kept the table as neat as possible. Did I never throw my clutter on the table again? Of course not, I still struggle with that change. Did his shoes disappear from the bedroom completely? Of course not, and I if I ask him to move them, he does. And if he asks me to clean the table, it's done.

      It sounds so stupid after typing it all out, but it's a great representation of how my partner and I understand that we are sharing a space and a life. We would never ask each other to completely change, but we can express how certain actions make us feel individually and change accordingly so that we live happily together. When conflict arises between the two of us, we take a moment, think about the other person's point of view, and respond.

      Soaring is not easy at first, but the more you do it the easier it gets.
