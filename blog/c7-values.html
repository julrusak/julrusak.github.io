  <h1>Stereotype Threat and Values</h1>

  <h4>An exercise in investigating your values.</h4>
    <p>
      When I think back on the times which I felt most accomplished and proud of myself, the following values come to mind;
      <ul>
        <li>Accomplishment</li>
        <li>Achievement</li>
        <li>Ambition</li>
        <li>Commitment</li>
        <li>Creativity</li>
        <li>Excellence</li>
        <li>Growth</li>
        <li>Insight</li>
        <li>Inspiration</li>
        <li>Persistence</li>
        <li>Personal Development</li>
        <li>Vibrancy</li>
        <li>Will-power</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, I try to live up to these values: (Disagree 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 Agree)
      <ul>
        <li>Accomplishment - 5</li>
        <li>Achievement - 5</li>
        <li>Ambition - 5</li>
        <li>Commitment - 5</li>
        <li>Creativity - 5</li>
        <li>Excellence - 5</li>
        <li>Growth - 5</li>
        <li>Insight - 5</li>
        <li>Inspiration - 5</li>
        <li>Persistence - 5</li>
        <li>Personal Development - 5</li>
        <li>Vibrancy - 5</li>
        <li>Will-power - 5</li>
      </ul>

      As I was going through this next part of the execise, I kept thinking "Wow! That's a lot of 5's", but I do really try to live up to these values in daily life. Sure, I struggle with some but these values seem to be my core values. These values are what drive me to challenge myself and dive into the deepend. These are the same values that make me think that I can work two or three jobs at a time and still go to school, which was an experience I learned from but will not do again. Ultimately, I'm propelled by these values so I'll pick one that really stands out and dive a little deeper into why it is important to me.

  <h4>Growth</h4>

    <p>
      Growth is incredibly important to me. I am not the person I was 5 years ago and I will not be this person in 5 years from now. I am constantly learning and shaping my view of the world. The decisions I make now are influenced by all of the decisions I have made in the past. I am constantly making mistakes, and I am constantly learning from them. When I was 18 I knew it all. When I was 22 I really knew it all. At 25 I realized that if I'm still learning then I cannot possibly know it all. Currently, at 33, I admit I know very little. Sure, I'm educated, but there is so much room for growth. I have no clue where I will be in 10 years and I love that! I love knowing that I just don't know. I cannot predict how I will grow in the next decade but I know that it will happen. The best thing I have done for myself is getting to the point of understanding that I am allowed to learn and mess things up, I can change the course as many times as I'd like, and I can invite whomever I wish along for the ride (though they may not accept) but I am not done growing.

   <h4>Advice</h4>

    <p>
      The last time someone asked me for advice it was concerning a big move due to a job offer. It directly related to growth, personal development, and ambition. Moving is hard and expensive but your personal development is priceless. I'll always advise someone to take the tougher path if it will inspire growth and ignite personal development. Changing jobs and careers can be tough, there's a loss of community and security for some time. Until you settle in to your new position you may feel lonely. However, staying in one place is worse. I'm a huge fan of WIlliam G.T. Shedd's quote- "A ship is safe in harbor, but that's not what ships are for."

  <h4>Using Values Against Stereotype Threat</h4>

    <p>
      I feel stereotype threat the most in situations where I am the only female in a situation. Keeping my values in mind will definitely help in that situation. Reminding myself that if others think a particular way about me simply because I'm a woman, that is their problem to deal with. I am on my own journey and focused on my development that I cannot let someone else stunt my growth. Especially because of a stereotype.
