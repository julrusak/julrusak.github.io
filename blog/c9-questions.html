  <h1>Asking Questions</h1>

      <i>"The wise man doesn't give the right answers, he poses the right questions."</i> -Claude Levi-Strauss
    </p>
    <p>
      French anthropologist Levi-Strauss was onto something. A key part in getting what you want, or need, is asking the right questions. From relationships to Doctor's advice, to the proper Google results, posing the right question can prevent a lot of headaches. Let's dissect the who, what, when, where, why, and how's of asking questions.
    </p>

    <h3>Who?</h3>
      <p>
        Knowing whom to ask your question is very important. You need to ask <i>yourself</i> a few questions before determining your source.
          <ul>
            <li>Does my question require the help of an expert or professional?</li>
            <li>Am I looking for an opinion or advice?</li>
            <li>Is this something I can research on the internet?</li>
          </ul>
        Obviously, if what you are asking is something you can find on the internet, go ahead and plug your question into your favorite search engine and start getting results. The art of Googling comes naturally to me, but you may need to reword your question. In fact, try not asking a question but try writing key words and see what comes up. While learning to code, I would often search 'ruby split number' or 'loop until JavaScript'. You'd be surpirsed the information you will find by searching for a few key words. That's all search engines really look at anyway (I think) so typing 'I would like to split a number using the ruby language' is a waste of my time.
      </p>

    <h3>What?</h3>
      <p>
        Exactly what is it that you are seeking? Let's be real. If you need medical care or advice, Web MD is <i>not</i> your best option. Call your actual doctor. For every symptom I can think of, Web MD says it's either harmless or fatal. So, how would that advice help you? What you are hoping to gain from your question is important. Even something as simple as directions. To get from point A to point B there are probably numerous ways to travel. One is easy, one is fast, and one is free. So which route do you want? No money for tolls? Looks like your taking the free option. Need to get there fast? You see where I'm going. So using words like 'best' and 'quickest' are helpful. In programming, start out by asking the easiest way to achieve something. Or a beginner's way. When searching for answers to my questions, I often found the quickest way to accomplish somthing with code but I wouldn't understand what was going on, so I wouldn't use it in my program. Perhaps get specific with your parameters. Saying 'using exactly this method, can I do x to achieve y and how would you write that?'
      </p>

    <h3>When?</h3>
      <p>
        Whenever you have finally formulated the question. When you have thought about it for a moment. If you are collaborating and you need to ask a question but don't immediately know how, take a moment and think out what it is that you want to know. If you are able to talk your way through it, even better.
      </p>

    <h3>Where?</h3>
      <p>
        So, this kind of circles back to the questions you are asking yourself in the who section. Where exaclty you seek advice is important in getting the right response. If it's a problem with your plumbing, my best guess is on the phone with a plumber, or your super. If it's about a specific event with an organization, a concise email sounds best. And then, there's always the online community. There are various websites aimed specifically at folks who ask questions and others who answer. This is sort of the crux of the blog post. Asking questions to the online community can be challenging. This is where specificity is not an option. If you are asking how to improve your code (due to it not working or not working quite right) then post an image of your code. Take a screen shot of the code and the output in your terminal, errors and all, and explain exactly what it is you would like your code to do. I posted once asking why my code wasn't working. The question was pretty bare as I had included the code I had written and images of the error messages. It was easy for someone else to see what I had written and point out what my errors were.
      </p>

    <h3>Why?</h3>
      <p>
        Because you should always question everything! But really, it's to help you be better at whatever it is your working on. You want to seek further knowledge, so a bit of what Levi-Strauss was hinting at was when you ask questions, seek to deepen your knowledge. Don't ask because you can, ask because you want to, because you need to know the information you seek. Develop your talents and skills by asking others best practices. Ask what they would tell themselves a month ago, a year ago, at the start of their career?
      </p>

    <h3>How?</h3>
      <p>
        By taking your time to be as specific as you can be. By searching for questions like yours on the internet before reaching out. By reading the questions others have posted and trying to determine which ones are clear and which are too vague. The more questions you ask, the better you'll be at asking!
      </p>

    <p>
      Happy Coding!
