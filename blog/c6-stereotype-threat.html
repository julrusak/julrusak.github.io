  <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
  <h2>I'm just a girl.</h2>
  <h4>July 24, 2015</h4>

      During this year's superbowl, Always ran <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Ep0O5fWN4">this commercial</a> investigating the effects of our words on young girls which thrust me into tears. My husband, sitting next to me, was shocked. How could I, a strong and determined woman, fall to pieces during a two minute advertisement? Well, my toughness and determination is the direct result of years spent fighting comments such as "...like a girl" or "...like a lady" and working hard to prove that I really can do anything you can do. And give me some time, I might do it better.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm incredibly privileged that I didn't let my sex determine my interests or performance. As a child I hated the color pink for the pure reason that girls were 'supposed' to like it, I climbed trees, I played sports, and I was competitive. I was not sugar and spice and everything nice. Most days I was covered in dirt from biking the backwoods I lived near. I still danced and did gymnastics and had a barbie collection, I just didn't like when someone limited me because I didn't have a penis. That is not my fault and everyone has a fifty-fifty chance of getting a penis anyway, so just shut it and let me jump off the side of the house and into the pool, Ma!
    </p>

      However, <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html">stereotype threat</a> set in somewhere in my early twenties. I was in a series of abusive relationships and didn't really like who or where I was in life so I made some small steps towards improving my life. I moved to New York City, I began studing Theatre Arts hoping to burst into the theatre scene, and I recognized self-destructive behavior and forged a path to stray from bad patterns. But still, for a few years I felt that my actions were 'typical of a woman', like if I cried or said something unintelligent. I felt that there were things I couldn't or shouldn't do simply because I was a woman. This caused me to limit myself. I spent my childhood proving people wrong and all of a sudden I started acting as if I deserved a limited and painful lot in life because Eve ate that stupid apple.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't remember when I exited this stage. I don't know if it was sudden or gradual, but I do know that I found that courage and confidence that I had as a child to allow myself to act as I please, regardless of how a 'lady' should be. I started working as an electrician in the theatre and picked up power tools and hauled ladders around. I still feel a hint of stereotype threat when I start a job somewhere in a new theatre and I'm surrounded by men, but once the work begins, I can prove myself with my actions. Plus, I've worked with horrible male theatre technicians. One guy tried to tell me I apologize too much and said he hates how women do that, then he messed up his entire job and DIDN'T APOLOGIZE. I guess I haven't come to any real conclusion except, thanks to social media, I have read numerous articles about women empowerment and it has helped me in the workforce. We are in an age where everything can easily be shared and seen. If stereotype threat is concerning you, read some empowering articles and know that someone else doesn't determine your greatness! So go out there and fight like a girl. A bad-ass girl.
