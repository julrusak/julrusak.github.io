  <h1>Gregorc Thinking Style</h1>
  <h2>Harnessing the power of your thinking style.</h2>
  <h4>June 30, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
        What <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html"> thinking style</a> are you? Knowing your thinking style can help you understand how you process information and help you when learning new and challenging material.
    </p>
    <p>
        Concrete Random thinkers, like me, like to experiment to find answers and take risks. We rely on our intuition and like to solve problems independently. This last bit I find to be least helpful when learning. I never did well in study groups and now that I am pair programming a lot, I find myself always thinking that challenges would be easier if I just did them myself.
    </p>
    <p>
        Concrete Random thinkers learn best when using trial-and-error approaches and are engaged in some form of competition. Yup. I'm competitive. Even when it comes down to the smallest thing. I've always wanted to prove I'm the best, even when I'm certain I'm not. Perhaps this is a good quality that I can use to ensure my success, but as I've grown older, I have defintely learned how to tame the competitive beast. As for trail-and-error, I can only say that this is a fantastic learning method for any thinker. Benjamin Franklin is quoted as saying "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work." Find those ways that won't work.

    </p>
    <p>
        As for difficulties, Concrete Random thinkers don't like restrictions, formal reports, re-working, keeping detailed records, showing work, choosing one answer, and limited options. Whew. That's a lot to dislike, but some are definitely true for me. For one, I sometimes don't like to show my work because of that whole trial-and-error process. That's a lot of work. Also, I don't always like choosing one answer. I can't even choose one ice cream flavor most times. Thank you inventor of the double scoop. But routines? Bring it. I love a good routine. I'll eat the same thing for breakfast for weeks because routines are easier. Routines are the answer. Maybe routines are my answer to showing my work. BJ Fogg gave a great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdKUJxjn-R8">Ted Talk</a> about tiny habits. Students beginning Dev Bootcamp were encouraged to watch and determine if his method is right for them. I have to say, this was a big key to opening some doors for me. I know that I can't change everything at the same time. But, identifying how my thinking style affects my workflow, I can make tiny changes to my daily habits and work towards success.
    </p>
    <p>
        How? Well, I know that I'm not good at documenting my progress. I can put in place a tiny change, that every 30 minutes I write down the progress I've made. If I've made no progress, then write that. Eventually, I won't feel good about writing 'no progress made' and I'll make some serious progress. Another tiny change, which Dev Bootcamp requires, is to start collaborating with other students more. The more I pair on challenges, the better I'll become at communicating my ideas while remaining respectful and open to collaboration.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, learn your thinking style and consider strategies to help your learning!
    </p>
    <p>
        Happy Coding!
