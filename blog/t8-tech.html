  <h1>How Does the Internet Work?</h1>
  <h2>You've got mail!</h2>

      I know what you're thinking. "I've been using the internet for over a decade, I know how it works." And you probably do, sort of.
    </p>

    <p>
      First, the internet is not a cloud. It is not a bubble in the sky holding information. The internet is basically a series of wires and servers. Any computer or device linked into those wires can access most files on those servers using an internet protocol address. Let's break it down.
    </p>

    <p>
      Servers hold information in the form of files. Every webpage is just a page of text, Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML), styled with some more text, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and maybe made to interact using another page of text, JavaScript. If you don't believe me, go to any webpage and right click on the page then select Inspect Element. What you will see are the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files containing the text that make up your webpage. It's true!
    </p>

    <p>
     So, servers hold all of these files and each server has an IP address. This is exactly like a mailing address, it tells files where to go. Not only do servers have IP addresses, so does your computer, phone, and tablet. Basically, if it connects to the web it has an IP address. This is how information like emails and Facebook posts can be accessed by others. Also, web pages have IP address within the server and these addresses are linked to the domain name so that you can type www.google.com and get to Google's home page. While your computer does have an IP address, this does not make your computer a server. You can store files on your computer and if you write up some HTML and CSS files you can access them locally on your own computer, but I wouldn't be able to see those files from my computer until you upload them to a server directly connected to the internet.
    </p>

    <p>
      I bet you're thinking, "Um, I thought I was directly connected to the internet?" Not really. You are accessing the internet through an Internet Service Provider, or ISP. Whether you use Verizon, Time Warner, or good ol' dial up AOL, you are connected to their services using a router to access the internet. You are not directly plugged into the internet. This is why you have to hit 'send' on an email or 'submit' on a Facebook post. You are sending the data in those files to the appropriate server, without even realizing it. When that server retreives the data it will complete any next steps, like sending the email to the proper IP address, or posting the image to the proper page. Just like the actual post office, the mail or package is sent to a transfer unti where trained individuals complete the next steps. Only unlike the USPS, the data sent is broken up into tiny bits then reassembled on arrival. Pretty neat, huh?
    </p>

    <p>
      So now you know how the internet works. It's astounding to think that this technology exists and that it sounds so simple.
    </p>

    <p>Happy Coding!</p>
