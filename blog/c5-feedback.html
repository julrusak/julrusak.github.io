  <h1>The Collaborative Workflow and Feedback</h1>
  <h2> How'd I do?</h2>
  <h4>July 18, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
        Working in a collaborative setting is common in Web Development. There are many benefits, more eyes on the code to check for syntax errors, more minds to brainstorm solutions, and more creative energy adding to the mix. This is not something foreign to me coming from a theatre background. When working on a show as a designer, I am one small part of the larger framework. I feel that my training has prepared me well to pair during coding challenges, but that doesn't mean I don't run into some bumps in the road.
    </p>
    <p>
        Communication is key. While that saying is cliche, it is the truth. If I don't say how I feel, then my pair won't know. If I agree to using code that I don't understand, I'm not really contributing to the work flow. It's hard to communicate. I'm fortunate that I work with kids and can hone my communication skills. Kids take what you say as literal, so over the years I have been able to edit myself in the moment. When I pair on coding challenges, I try to ensure that we have discussed our expectations before we begin. It may help to discuss strengths and weaknesses. You may discover that you have different strengths which will make it easier to challenge yourselves! Communicating can often be difficult, you may have trouble saying what you feel, but take a moment, get your thoughts together, and at least let your pair know you are uncomfortable or confused.
    </p>
    <p>
        Feedback is an amazing beast. Without it, we don't know what to work on, but reading it exposes the weaknesses others see in you, which you may not see in yourself. When I read my feedback, I try to look for common themes. It's obvious that I'm still learning Ruby vocabulary and syntax, so when I see that come up in my feedback, I'm almost relieved that I can see my own weaknesses instead of remaining oblivious. I was definitely nervous the first time I saw a page of my feedback but I reminded myself that I am not even a good programmer, I am a true newbie, and that any feedback is useful because I want to be a great programmer and I need to know what to work on.

    </p>
    <p>
        Writing feedback is an entirely different challenge. I want to be honest and sincere but remain kind. I want to write the kind of useful feedback that I would want to receive. Honestly, the better the partner, the harder the feedback. I find it most difficult to suggest actionable improvement. The harder the pair, the easier the feedback. Which would I rather have? Easier pair, obviously.
    </p>
    <p>
        So think about how you view yourself, and consider reaching out for feedback. Sometimes, I initially cringe and think 'don't tell me what to do', then I think for a minute and come around to the thought, 'yeah, good suggestion.' It's sometimes hard to digest, but know that feedback can and will make you a better programmer, or better anything for that matter!
    </p>
    <p>
        Happy Coding!
