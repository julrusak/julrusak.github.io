      <h3> What is my story?</h3>
         <p>I grew up idolizing the cast members of Saturday Night Live, so I'm your typical funny gal. I moved to New York City at 21 to pursue a career on the stage. I had always loved the feeling of being on stage. I quickly found out that I do not love the feeling of being in an audition. I was well into my 20's before I understood that filmmaking is an art form, not just entertainment. I remember the moment I realized 'my parents were right all along' and subsequently realized 'adults have great advice!' Due to this realization, I will often stop and take in a moment, forcing my brain to remember each detail.

      <h3> Random Thoughts</h3>
         <p>If you say a word repeatedly, eventually that word sounds odd. I did this with the word yogurt.</p>
         <p>I think all humans see different colors, but we'll never know because it is difficult to explain color without referencing the color itself or another color.</p>
         <p>I'm completely convinced life exists outside of Earth and they probably have figured it out better than us.</p>
         <p>After reading Jurassic Park, I began to wonder if deep under the Earth's surface there were bones from a species we have yet to discover.</p>
