        	So, I'm not really a writer...yet. What I mean is, I don't consider myself a writer though this blog is, sort of, also serving the purpose of working on my writing skills. I know that in order to be skilled at anything, one needs to build those skills through practice, so I hope you enjoy these daily exercises!

    	<p>
    		A long time ago, I was that girl in the back of a yoga class proud of my forward fold - a product of years of dance lessons - but scared and unwilling to attempt any pose that I knew would cause me to fall forward or straight down. 
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		I don't remember exactly when it was, but as I started making small attempts to lift one leg in crow or turn my head upwards in half moon, I stopped getting the overwhelming feeling that I was going to fall. And then it happened, it seemed like overnight but it was, in fact, years later, I stopped caring if I fell and started trying everything. Handstand? I'm gonna flip over, don't care, I'm trying it! EPK II? Not happeneing, BUT, I no was no longer limiting myself - here we go! There was something so fulfilling having made the attempt. Having found that belief in myself and just tried, because you know what happened? I started holding some of these poses, then I started feeling the confidence to try more advanced poses and the cycle continued. 
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		Ultimately, yoga is not about getting your body into a complicated pose, it's about the connection to your body and your journey into these poses. So enjoy your journey but if you're telling yourself "I can't", start telling yourself, "I'll try."
