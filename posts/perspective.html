        	â€œYou have to create love and affection for your body, for what it can do for you." ~B.K.S. Iyengar

    		I recently saw one of those inspirational images people post on Instagram, the sunset backdrop with a quote in the center. I find truth and, well inspiration, in some of these and this particular one I wish I had seen years ago. It said something along the lines of 'Exercise is not punishment for a poor diet, it is a celebration of what your body can do.' I thought, 'crap, if I had that perspective this whole time perhaps I would have done way more with my body!'

    		Last weekend, while suffering from an ear infection, I wound up hurting myself so I needed to get some antibacterial ear drops so as not to cause a bigger infection. Well, I had some insurance woes at the pharmacy and wound up on the phone with my company only to find out I needed to call a different company and I tried to bypass selecting all the menu options and was then rerouted back to the beginning of the automated call and then......I stopped. I was angry and I could tell that if I spoke to someone I would be unpleasant. So I thought for a moment about how I need ONE prescription TOPS every year. There are people in this world who need prescriptions to live, they deal with these insurance woes daily. I took a moment to calm down and celebrate my health. I took a moment to remind myself to be patient with the health industry because I can, because I am afforded that privilege. I shifted my perspective from the time I was losing on a Saturday afternoon, to the amount of time I do have by being healthy. 
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		So, I'm making strides in shifting my perspective. Thinking less about the things I don't have and more about the things I do. Celebrating what I can do, and not letting what I can't do get me down.
