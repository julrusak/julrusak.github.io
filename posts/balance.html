        	Some days I want to practice in the morning, then take class, then practice again at home. Some days I want to take four naps. It's called balance. 
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		Some days I want to eat all the vegetables and drink all the green juice and tea. Some days I want bbq pulled pork and a bottle of wine. It's called balance. 
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		Some days I hit tree pose and extend my leg and turn my head then bring my leg forward then smoothly transition into warrior three then land beautifully in warrior two. Some days I slam my leg down getting into tree pose. It's a tricky little thing called balance.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		I used to love teaching yoga to my middle school students back when I taught a variety of creative arts. I brought yoga into the classroom to teach them something calming which requires focus, and I loved teaching them about balance. I didn't always live a balanced life, I was incredibly gluttonous. I couldn't understand the people who would make a healthy dinner choice because they made an unhealthy lunch choice. All of my choices were unhealthy. I don't know if it was just a byproduct of getting older or if it was years of reading about food and nutrition and going vegetarian, then vegan, then completely raw for that one month in 2009, but I lead a much more balanced life now. My body helps lead that balance, too. If I have too many sweets over the weekend I find myself craving some fresh juice in the morning and a salad for lunch on Monday. If I have too much wine at night my body craves water and lemon, not a greasy cheeseburger anymore. And when my muscles are sore and I need some quality rest, I take a nap and help my muscles rebuild. Then come Saturday, I wake and and practice inversions for an hour leaving my shoulders feeling like they've been in battle. 
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		So strive to find balance in all you do. Don't beat yourself up for eating cake. Don't beat yourself up at all. Live your best damn life.
