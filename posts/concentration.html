        	I was never the kind of person that worked at something in which I didn't immediately show signs of talent or potential, which is sad. I always wanted to draw but could never draw anyting worth displaying so I told myself "I don't have that talent." Same thing goes for writing. It was in my late twenties that I began to understand the concept of practicing something until you show signs of improvement and then continue to practice until, well, forever.
    	</p>
    	<p>
        	I was also the type of person that wanted to get to the end of things, when I began learning how to code, I wanted to be job ready as quickly as possible. I went to grad school for theater with the intention of mastering something in two years. How the heck can you master something in two years? How the heck can you be job ready in a new field in less than a few years? Eventually, I realized you can't.

    		I attribute this, in part, to a lack of concentration. I wanted the end result without the daily work. I wanted the reward, the success, the recognition without the putting in the time. But it's always been different with yoga.

        	I worked for years, YEARS before I held crow pose, and when it happened it just, sort of, stuck. It was the result of years of holding my arms in position and picking up one foot at a time. It was numerous attempts at lifting both feet and falling on my face. It was concentration and practice. I didn't stick it on the first try, but I built the foundation in order to get there. And now I'll do crow pose just about anywhere, because I think it is important to celebrate successes. though now I have my eye on the work and progression and, just like crow pose, I put in the time. I hit the mat daily, I set my intention, and I direct my concentration towards my practice, because as stated in the Bhagavad Gita, "Never let the fruits of your action be your motive."
