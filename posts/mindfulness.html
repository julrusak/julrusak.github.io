          "When the senses are stilled, when the mind is at rest, when the intellect wavers not - then, say the wise, is reached the highest stage. This steady control of the senses and mind has been defined as Yoga. He who attains it is free from delusion."

          For most of my young adult life, I lived in the future. I was incredibly unhappy and impatient with the present. I was constantly working on some exciting and perfectly planned future life, and by constantly changing these plans I was never truly working towards anything. Also, by focusing my energy on my future self, I was rarely - if ever - focusing my energy on my present self. I was a bit short-tempered, I was rude to people and masked it with this false perception that I was being funny, and I was selfish. 
        </p>
        <p>
          It was when I began practicing yoga regularly and truly listening to the words of my teachers, that caused a shift in my daily thinking habits. They spoke of presence, mindfulness, and patience. I was asked to dedicate my practice to someone who needs some positive energy. I was asked to forget about the future, to forget about anything outside of this moment on the mat, and focus on the present. It was impossible at first. I most definitely continued to plan my day while holding downward dog for five breaths. Then it became easier to push those thoughts out of my head for ten minutes, then twenty, then all sixty minutes. Then I experimented with home meditation, and I remember a night in 2010 arriving home so angry with the events of the day and wanting so badly to go eat ice cream then have a beer, but instead I turned off all the lights, plopped on the floor and stopped thinking. Just listening to my breath, knowing that my breath is what powers me. It is a constant. I came out of those thirty minutes of meditation relaxed and connected to myself. I understand that I can only control my thoughts and actions.

          Having realized that I can grow as a person, and also realizing that this growth will never cease, I began to see others differently. I began to see the potential in others. I began to think about people who may not be so pleasant and how they are on their own journey. Most importantly, I slowed down and began considering how my actions matter. I still struggle, it's hard being kind and patient in a big city ALL THE TIME, but I get better every single time someone walks in front of my bike when I have the light.
