        	Wow. That's the first word that comes to mind. Just, wow. If I had to sum up my experience of the first weekend of Yoga Teacher Training, 18 hours total, in a few words, they would be overwhelming, exhausting, enlightening, inspiring. I know this sounds unbelievable, but I am definitely already a different person. 
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		My intention for the weekend was to remain present the entire time, and I did fairly well, only a few outside thoughts crept inside my brain space and I was able to quickly push them out. This will definitely get easier as this training continues. 
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		I feel a bit brain tired from such intense, prolonged focus - but I am so excited to learn more. We barely brushed the surface in 18 hours. However, in that short amount of time I am so much more fascinated with the body and much less interested in material 'stuff.' This idea of letting everything go has carried me through the weekend and into Monday, with a different perspective on self care. 
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		One statement that resonated with me was actually a side comment made about how we are all in YTT because yoga has probably changed us and we want to give that gift to others. I can honestly say that yoga has changed my life. Not just the sequence of poses that has made me physically stronger, but the mindfulness and shift in outlook as well. So, I offer you this, if you have ever thought "yoga's cool, I like working out but I'm not in to meditating" go find a quiet space right now and turn off your mind. Do it. It's hard, really hard, and maybe that's why it turns people off.

    		It's really easy to not do the hard things.
