          10 weeks of yoga teacher training has made a significant impact on my life. Since week 1, back in September, I have been in an overwhelmed state of awe. I came in to the training knowing there was more to yoga than just what is done in class or on the mat. I came out of the training calm, dedicated to spreading kindness, and ready to embrace a life of learning and progressing in my practice. 
      	</p>
        <p>
          The biggest change has been the amount of time spent meditating, which is, historically, the main component of the yoga practice. While my headstand has improved, I'm more excited about the increase in the amount of time I can sit and focus. We spent much time thorughout the program disecting the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, which you can find <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Sutras-Patanjali-Swami-Satchidananda/dp/1938477073" target="_blank">here</a>. Patanjali describes yoga as the 'stilling of the changing states of mind', which is achieved through a dedicated meditation practice. It is in the practice of meditation where I can see the most rewards lie.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started meditating twice a month at the <a href="https://www.opencenter.org/" target="_blank">Open Center in Midtown</a> during lunch and when I return to the office the change in me is so noticeable. I feel like I can tackle anything. I feel like any issues with my work are trivial. It's beautiful. It's mind-altering! It is something I plan to do more often in the new year. 
        </p>
        <p>
          So, how do I meditate? 
        </p>
        <p>
          While there are many techniques, I continue to use my mala beads. A long string of 108 beads that provide a meditation map of sorts. I choose a mantra and, while working the beads one at a time through my hands, I pause at each bead and mentally recite the mantra. My mantra of choice is 'Om Namah Shivaya' which translates to 'I offer to Shiva a respectful invocation of His Name.' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva" target="_blank">Shiva</a> is the God of Destruction, among other things. So, by dedicating my meditation practice to Shiva, I'm seeking the destruction of all things negative and wasteful which I carry within me. Intolerance, impatience, ignorance, lethargy. Things I don't want. Things I don't need. 
        </p>
        <p>
          There is so much more to speak about and I hope to share it all with you. I am putting together some plans to teach. I hope I see you there!
