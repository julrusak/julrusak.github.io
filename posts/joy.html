        <p>
        	For those who are quite close to me it may seem rather spontaneous that I decided to begin this journey of becoming a registered yoga teacher. Yoga was not something I really talked about, it was like my secret joy. And it's exactly that feeling of joy that was the catalyst for this decision.
        </p>
        <p>
        	This past January I joined the most wonderful gym in all of New York City. One of my closest friends was a member and I knew the day that I could afford to work out within those walls, I would do just that. <a href="mff.com" style="color:#9e9668;">Mark Fisher Fitness </a> is an amazing place of ridiculous humans who made me feel like a beautiful rare unicorn, capable of anything. My first summer at MFF one of the trainers posed a question, "Is there a return of investment when it comes to joy?" So she conducted an experiment. 30 days of Joy, otherwise known as ROIJOY.
        </p>
        <p>
        	The first assignment of ROIJOY was to do one thing each day that brought you joy. At first, I found this difficult as joy is a very particular feeling. It's like happiness or excitement or elation, but not quite. I thought for a long time, 'What brings me joy?' And while I came up with many things that bring me happy, I felt that the one guaranteed moment of joy is the feeling I experience at the end of yoga class, when all your muscles are tired and hot, when your body is limber, and you're drenched in sweat and you lie on the mat for a stretch of meditation and success mixes with relief mixes with gratitude and the outcome is just pure joy. 
        </p>
        <p>
        	So that was my gift to myself that month, which also happened to be my birthday month. I vowed to practice yoga every day. To soak in the joy from savasana, the final pose (corpse pose), and see if my joy could be spread to others. In a perfect world, I would have been able to take class everyday, but I was often left to practice at home. For the first few days, things went really well, then I found myself wishing I knew more about the practice of yoga. Why were classes sequenced in such a specific way? What are all the variations for the many poses I know? What are all the poses I don't know?! How can I get my body into all those poses that I didn't know but now have found and, whoa, they look difficult? 
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		And that's where we are today. A few months after setting the intention to practice everyday, I have done my best to commit. I fell sick for a few weeks and just, sort of, rolled around on the floor but I practiced. It's not always easy, but it is always full of joy.
