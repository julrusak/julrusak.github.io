        	Plants make no plans, they only reach for the sun - or so the saying goes. I had dinner with a friend last night and we discussed personal growth. Something that is difficult to assess in the moment, but when you look back and realize how much you have grown, it's such a wonderful feeling. I think it is very important to place a focus on growth. 
    	</p>
      <p>
        I've said this a few times before, but it's such a wonderful way to approach life that I'll repeat it forever - there's a saying at my gym that you should work towards being 'One percent better.' That's it. One tiny percent. How you measure that is up to you, but if you focus each day on becomming one percent better, eventually you'll be a whole lot better. Better at what, you ask? Anything. Better at weight lifting, better at running, better at relationships, better at yoga or knitting or the pottery wheel. You decide. The only thing important is that you grow and, while doing so, you make mistakes. You learn from those mistakes and then you work towards that one percent. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The thing is, it is easy to be one percent better. It's easy to practice something today. It's not so easy to be the best by the end of the year or to accomplish all the things by tomorrow. So why set yourself up for failure? Wouldn't it be so much better to set yourself up for success? 
      </p>
      <p>
        For me, this is so easy to embrace. If I'm having an off day I can remind myself that I only need to focus on one percent. And, to be honest, I can put off one percent for a day. I can even put off one percent for a weekend, and after a few days I don't feel defeated. I don't feel that I've forgotten my goals or reached a point where they're unattainable. Because it's easy to get back on the horse if all I have to focus on is one percent.
