        	"It is through the alignment of the body that I discovered the alignment of my mind, self, and intelligence." ~B.K.S. Iyengar
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		Being present is hard, and not just for 60 minutes while bending and stretching your body, but all the time. I recently gave advice to my 13 year old cousin as she begins her journey through high school. One of the things I told her was "If enough people are saying it, there might be some truth to it." What I was referrring to was the constant quotes you hear about enjoying the present, loving yourself, and failing in order to learn. You hear these quotes over and over while your young and often times people wait too long to start incorporating that advice into their lives.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		I guess I'm happy that I came to this realization early as I do my best to take common advice to heart. I work towards loving myself and my body in it's current state, I work towards being kind, I take trips and time off when I can and I stop and sit in a park or on the side of a mountain and take that moment in as often as possible. 
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		I also work towards being present at all times. Living in the moment. I cannot change the past so there is little achieved from constantly thinking about it and as for the future, the seeds I plant today will bear beautiful fruits as long as I tend to them daily, through presence.
