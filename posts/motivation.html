        	So, as stated in an earlier post, I found inspiration in an experiment on joy. I went to classes and practiced at home. In need of more at-home yoga 'material', I turned to instagram and what I found was, essentially, an entire world of insta-yogis.  
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		Tara Stiles recently <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BJtthapBJIp/?taken-by=tarastiles">posted</a> about Instagram teaching people that yoga is about contorting your body into impossible poses. Her post stopped me in my tracks for a minute because I was conflicted. She makes a valid point. I most definitely would think, "how does someone's back <i>do that</i>?" and maybe attempt the challenging pose and sometimes fall and sometimes get prepared and realize, "Not today!"
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		But then I started seeing posts where yogis would place, side-by-side, pictures of them years ago and now in the same pose and you could see how they had progressed over the years, some over the months, and I stopped thinking I could never become that flexible and started working towards becoming that flexible. Also, there were many times I would be lounging on the couch, sipping iced coffee and I would open instagram and see numerous posts from different yogis and I was instantly motivated. Driven, not by a desire to look like them, but by the knowledge that daily practice is what will strengthen my body and build my flexibility, and more importantly bring me joy. 
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		I understand Tara's post in relation to people who may not understand the journey required for many of these yogis to be able to do these poses. Some yogis do appear superhuman or spineless - and not in the ****** way.
