    <span>TECHNICAL THOUGHTS</span>
    <div class="blurb">My career transition to tech was difficult. I cried a few times thinking I would never be able to learn this much material, now I laugh because I know I'll never be able to learn it all! I taught myself for over a year and then went to Dev Bootcamp, an experience that changed my life. I work at a creative agency in Rails, AngularJS, Wordpress, Sass, and a myriad of other tools. Below is the beginning of a tech blog which I began while studying at DBC. I'll add to it periodically as I have a lot to share regarding the tech industry as well as my experience as a woman within the tech space.</div>

        <h1>Asking Questions</h1>
          <h2>Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How? </h2>
          <h4>August 15, 2015</h4>

          <section>
            <p>
              <i>"The wise man doesn't give the right answers, he poses the right questions."</i> -Claude Levi-Strauss
            </p>
            <p>
              French anthropologist Levi-Strauss was onto something. A key part in getting what you want, or need, is asking the right questions. From relationships to Doctor's advice, to the proper Google results, posing the right question can prevent a lot of headaches. Let's dissect the who, what, when, where, why, and how's of asking questions.
            </p>

            <h3>Who?</h3>
              <p>
                Knowing whom to ask your question is very important. You need to ask <i>yourself</i> a few questions before determining your source.
                  <ul>
                    <li>Does my question require the help of an expert or professional?</li>
                    <li>Am I looking for an opinion or advice?</li>
                    <li>Is this something I can research on the internet?</li>
                  </ul>
                Obviously, if what you are asking is something you can find on the internet, go ahead and plug your question into your favorite search engine and start getting results. The art of Googling comes naturally to me, but you may need to reword your question. In fact, try not asking a question but try writing key words and see what comes up. While learning to code, I would often search 'ruby split number' or 'loop until JavaScript'. You'd be surpirsed the information you will find by searching for a few key words. That's all search engines really look at anyway (I think) so typing 'I would like to split a number using the ruby language' is a waste of my time.
              </p>

            <h3>What?</h3>
              <p>
                Exactly what is it that you are seeking? Let's be real. If you need medical care or advice, Web MD is <i>not</i> your best option. Call your actual doctor. For every symptom I can think of, Web MD says it's either harmless or fatal. So, how would that advice help you? What you are hoping to gain from your question is important. Even something as simple as directions. To get from point A to point B there are probably numerous ways to travel. One is easy, one is fast, and one is free. So which route do you want? No money for tolls? Looks like your taking the free option. Need to get there fast? You see where I'm going. So using words like 'best' and 'quickest' are helpful. In programming, start out by asking the easiest way to achieve something. Or a beginner's way. When searching for answers to my questions, I often found the quickest way to accomplish somthing with code but I wouldn't understand what was going on, so I wouldn't use it in my program. Perhaps get specific with your parameters. Saying 'using exactly this method, can I do x to achieve y and how would you write that?'
              </p>

            <h3>When?</h3>
              <p>
                Whenever you have finally formulated the question. When you have thought about it for a moment. If you are collaborating and you need to ask a question but don't immediately know how, take a moment and think out what it is that you want to know. If you are able to talk your way through it, even better.
              </p>

            <h3>Where?</h3>
              <p>
                So, this kind of circles back to the questions you are asking yourself in the who section. Where exaclty you seek advice is important in getting the right response. If it's a problem with your plumbing, my best guess is on the phone with a plumber, or your super. If it's about a specific event with an organization, a concise email sounds best. And then, there's always the online community. There are various websites aimed specifically at folks who ask questions and others who answer. This is sort of the crux of the blog post. Asking questions to the online community can be challenging. This is where specificity is not an option. If you are asking how to improve your code (due to it not working or not working quite right) then post an image of your code. Take a screen shot of the code and the output in your terminal, errors and all, and explain exactly what it is you would like your code to do. I posted once asking why my code wasn't working. The question was pretty bare as I had included the code I had written and images of the error messages. It was easy for someone else to see what I had written and point out what my errors were.
              </p>

            <h3>Why?</h3>
              <p>
                Because you should always question everything! But really, it's to help you be better at whatever it is your working on. You want to seek further knowledge, so a bit of what Levi-Strauss was hinting at was when you ask questions, seek to deepen your knowledge. Don't ask because you can, ask because you want to, because you need to know the information you seek. Develop your talents and skills by asking others best practices. Ask what they would tell themselves a month ago, a year ago, at the start of their career?
              </p>

            <h3>How?</h3>
              <p>
                By taking your time to be as specific as you can be. By searching for questions like yours on the internet before reaching out. By reading the questions others have posted and trying to determine which ones are clear and which are too vague. The more questions you ask, the better you'll be at asking!
              </p>

            <p>
              Happy Coding!

        <h1>How Does the Internet Work?</h1>
          <h2>You've got mail!</h2>
          <h4>August 8, 2015</h4>

          <section>
            <p>
              I know what you're thinking. "I've been using the internet for over a decade, I know how it works." And you probably do, sort of.
            </p>

            <p>
              First, the internet is not a cloud. It is not a bubble in the sky holding information. The internet is basically a series of wires and servers. Any computer or device linked into those wires can access most files on those servers using an internet protocol address. Let's break it down.
            </p>

            <p>
              Servers hold information in the form of files. Every webpage is just a page of text, Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML), styled with some more text, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and maybe made to interact using another page of text, JavaScript. If you don't believe me, go to any webpage and right click on the page then select Inspect Element. What you will see are the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files containing the text that make up your webpage. It's true!
            </p>

            <p>
             So, servers hold all of these files and each server has an IP address. This is exactly like a mailing address, it tells files where to go. Not only do servers have IP addresses, so does your computer, phone, and tablet. Basically, if it connects to the web it has an IP address. This is how information like emails and Facebook posts can be accessed by others. Also, web pages have IP address within the server and these addresses are linked to the domain name so that you can type www.google.com and get to Google's home page. While your computer does have an IP address, this does not make your computer a server. You can store files on your computer and if you write up some HTML and CSS files you can access them locally on your own computer, but I wouldn't be able to see those files from my computer until you upload them to a server directly connected to the internet.
            </p>

            <p>
              I bet you're thinking, "Um, I thought I was directly connected to the internet?" Not really. You are accessing the internet through an Internet Service Provider, or ISP. Whether you use Verizon, Time Warner, or good ol' dial up AOL, you are connected to their services using a router to access the internet. You are not directly plugged into the internet. This is why you have to hit 'send' on an email or 'submit' on a Facebook post. You are sending the data in those files to the appropriate server, without even realizing it. When that server retreives the data it will complete any next steps, like sending the email to the proper IP address, or posting the image to the proper page. Just like the actual post office, the mail or package is sent to a transfer unti where trained individuals complete the next steps. Only unlike the USPS, the data sent is broken up into tiny bits then reassembled on arrival. Pretty neat, huh?
            </p>

            <p>
              So now you know how the internet works. It's astounding to think that this technology exists and that it sounds so simple.
            </p>

            <p>Happy Coding!</p>

        <h1>Exploring Conflict</h1>
          <h2>Stop, Observe, Assess, Respond!</h2>
          <h4>August 8, 2015</h4>

          <section>
            <p>
              I've worked for an amazing Community Building Organization for the last four years where we provide New York City public schools with various arts education, among many other services. Each year in our training we discuss how to SOAR. Stop, Observe, Assess, Respond. This is the opposite of reacting to a student who may be acting out or behaving in a negative way. We are trained to observe this student's behavior and to ask questions that will lead the student to a clam state. We are trained to assess why this student may be acting out; did this student just go through a major life change? A death in the family? A loss of housing? Has this student had food today? This week? This acronym has helped me tremendously as a teacher and I do my best to use  this technique throughout my daily life. It isn't always easy, sometimes I still react, but the more you put it into practice, the easier it will be to follow.
            </p>
            <p>
              The relationship I try my hardest to soar in is definitely my marriage. Any long-term relationship will battle conflict, and my husband and I are no different, but we don't fight ever (I know, I know) because we focus on understanding where the other person is coming from and how we would feel in the others' shoes. I don't have to wonder if my husband ate that day (as I love cooking breakfast) or if he is having a hard time at home, but when conflict hits I wonder what this means to him and what are the possible outcomes of the conflict. Even something as simple and 'stupid' as leaving my clutter on the table. My husband asked me one day if I could not leave my random mail and junk on the kitchen table. I reacted. He leaves his shoes next to the bed so I pointed to them and said "When you start putting your shoes away." He rightfully felt hurt. I was clearly not happy about the shoes for some time and never said anything. I let it build up. So when he asked me to change my behavior, instead of listening and starting a dialogue, I fired shots.
            </p>

            <p>
              Luckily, my husband is the most amazing man and let me respond again and this time soar. I took a moment and considered what my clutter on the table meant to him. When I want to sit and eat, I know exactly where my stuff belongs. When he wants to sit and eat, he doesn't know what to do with my belongings. I don't like his shoes next to the bed because sometimes I trip on them. So, I observed both of our behavior and promised to make a change. In return, I asked that he do his best to at least put his shoes under the bed. I set up a separate place for my clutter and junk mail and kept the table as neat as possible. Did I never throw my clutter on the table again? Of course not, I still struggle with that change. Did his shoes disappear from the bedroom completely? Of course not, and I if I ask him to move them, he does. And if he asks me to clean the table, it's done.
            </p>


            <p>
              It sounds so stupid after typing it all out, but it's a great representation of how my partner and I understand that we are sharing a space and a life. We would never ask each other to completely change, but we can express how certain actions make us feel individually and change accordingly so that we live happily together. When conflict arises between the two of us, we take a moment, think about the other person's point of view, and respond.
            </p>


            <p>
              Soaring is not easy at first, but the more you do it the easier it gets.

        <h1>Ruby Versus JavaScript</h1>
          <h2>The same, but different.</h2>
          <h4>August 1, 2015</h4>

          <section>
            <p>
              JavaScript and Ruby have much of the same qualities, which makes it easier to understand one if you know the other. They both accept integers, strings, booleans, and floats, among other objects. They both deal with arrays and hashes. They both have built-in methods or functions and BONUS some of them are abbreviated the same way! Like .push to add a value into an array and .map to iterate through an array! Some others are .reverse, to reverse an array or string, and .slice to remove a section of an array. This is super helpful when you are starting out, like I am. I find that I still have to look up a few key terms and the syntax is a bit different, but as a newbie, I can rely on some staple functions in my programs. Keep in mind that for each method called in JavaScript, you must follow it with (). Inside may go arguments or it may be left blank, but you need the parentheses. So let's look at some syntax and break down Ruby classes vs. JavaScript constructor functions!
            </p>

            <p>
              A Ruby class contains methods, like so;

            <pre class="ruby">
                class Human
                  def initialize (name, location)
                    @name = name
                    @location = location
                  end

                  def greeting
                    puts "Hi #{@name}!"
                  end

                  def small_talk
                    puts "How's the weather in #{@location}?"
                  end
            </pre>

              Fairly intuitive. You can understand exactly what is going on because Ruby is incredibly reader and user friendly. Let's look at the same in JavaScript.
            </p>

            <p>
              <pre>
                <code>
                  var human = {}
                  human.greeting = function(name){
                  return "Hi " + name + "!";
                }
                  human.smallTalk = function(location){
                  return "How's the weather in " + location + "?";
                }
                </code>
              </pre>
              This is, of course, only one way to write this as JavaScript accepts many ways of determining objects. But as you can see, there are less lines of code but more punctuation.
            </p>

            <p>
             While I am just starting out with both languages, I did form a quick bond with Ruby, which I didn't with JavaScript. Both languages make sense to me and both are very necessary as a developer. Perhaps in future blog posts I have a stronger opinion for either! Until then, keep learning!
            </p>

        <h1>Stereotype Threat and Values</h1>
          <h2>Value yo'self!</h2>
          <h4>August 1, 2015</h4>

          <section>
          <h4>An exercise in investigating your values.</h4>
            <p>
              When I think back on the times which I felt most accomplished and proud of myself, the following values come to mind;
              <ul>
                <li>Accomplishment</li>
                <li>Achievement</li>
                <li>Ambition</li>
                <li>Commitment</li>
                <li>Creativity</li>
                <li>Excellence</li>
                <li>Growth</li>
                <li>Insight</li>
                <li>Inspiration</li>
                <li>Persistence</li>
                <li>Personal Development</li>
                <li>Vibrancy</li>
                <li>Will-power</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              In general, I try to live up to these values: (Disagree 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 Agree)
              <ul>
                <li>Accomplishment - 5</li>
                <li>Achievement - 5</li>
                <li>Ambition - 5</li>
                <li>Commitment - 5</li>
                <li>Creativity - 5</li>
                <li>Excellence - 5</li>
                <li>Growth - 5</li>
                <li>Insight - 5</li>
                <li>Inspiration - 5</li>
                <li>Persistence - 5</li>
                <li>Personal Development - 5</li>
                <li>Vibrancy - 5</li>
                <li>Will-power - 5</li>
              </ul>

              As I was going through this next part of the execise, I kept thinking "Wow! That's a lot of 5's", but I do really try to live up to these values in daily life. Sure, I struggle with some but these values seem to be my core values. These values are what drive me to challenge myself and dive into the deepend. These are the same values that make me think that I can work two or three jobs at a time and still go to school, which was an experience I learned from but will not do again. Ultimately, I'm propelled by these values so I'll pick one that really stands out and dive a little deeper into why it is important to me.
            </p>

          <h4>Growth</h4>

            <p>
              Growth is incredibly important to me. I am not the person I was 5 years ago and I will not be this person in 5 years from now. I am constantly learning and shaping my view of the world. The decisions I make now are influenced by all of the decisions I have made in the past. I am constantly making mistakes, and I am constantly learning from them. When I was 18 I knew it all. When I was 22 I really knew it all. At 25 I realized that if I'm still learning then I cannot possibly know it all. Currently, at 33, I admit I know very little. Sure, I'm educated, but there is so much room for growth. I have no clue where I will be in 10 years and I love that! I love knowing that I just don't know. I cannot predict how I will grow in the next decade but I know that it will happen. The best thing I have done for myself is getting to the point of understanding that I am allowed to learn and mess things up, I can change the course as many times as I'd like, and I can invite whomever I wish along for the ride (though they may not accept) but I am not done growing.
            </p>

           <h4>Advice</h4>

            <p>
              The last time someone asked me for advice it was concerning a big move due to a job offer. It directly related to growth, personal development, and ambition. Moving is hard and expensive but your personal development is priceless. I'll always advise someone to take the tougher path if it will inspire growth and ignite personal development. Changing jobs and careers can be tough, there's a loss of community and security for some time. Until you settle in to your new position you may feel lonely. However, staying in one place is worse. I'm a huge fan of WIlliam G.T. Shedd's quote- "A ship is safe in harbor, but that's not what ships are for."
            </p>

          <h4>Using Values Against Stereotype Threat</h4>

            <p>
              I feel stereotype threat the most in situations where I am the only female in a situation. Keeping my values in mind will definitely help in that situation. Reminding myself that if others think a particular way about me simply because I'm a woman, that is their problem to deal with. I am on my own journey and focused on my development that I cannot let someone else stunt my growth. Especially because of a stereotype.

        <h1>Object Oriented Programming</h1>
          <h2>Just getting some closure.</h2>
          <h4>July 24, 2015</h4>

          <section>
            <p>
              Referred to as closures in computer programming, Blocks, Procs, and lambdas are very powerful when used in Ruby. Simply put, they are ways of grouping code that we want to run. Let us start with the easiest, blocks.
            </p>

          <h3>Blocks</h3>

            <p>
              Blocks are useful for repeating code and can be written two ways depending on how much code you need repeated. You can either use {} for a single line of code, or the word do followed bu end with the larger chunk of code in the middle. Example;
              <pre class="ruby">
                array = [1, 2, 3]
                  array.each { |value| value + 1 }
                end

                array = [1, 2, 3]
                  array.each do |v|
                    v + 1
                  end
              </pre>
              Both of these will go through each value in your index of numbers and add one to the value. But what if we wanted to use this exact block again and again? Luckily, there are procs!
            </p>

            <h3>Procs</h3>

            <p>
              Procs, or procedures, are objects that you can call as many times as needed. You can also call methods on procs!
              <pre class="ruby">
                array = [1, 2, 3]

                double = Proc.new { |n| p n*2 }

                array.each(double)

                # => [2, 3, 6]
              </pre>
              It's like making a new block and saving it for later! So why would we need anything else?
            </p>

            <h3>Lambdas</h3>

            <p>
              Lambdas are very similar to Procs only they do a few things differently. They check for arguments, and will return an error if there are more or less arguments, and they respond to the return keyword.
              <pre class="ruby">
                  lam_test = lambda { |x| puts x }
                  lam_test.call
                  # => 2

                  lam_test.call
                  # => ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (0 for 1)

                  lam_test.call(1,2,3)
                  # => ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (3 for 1)
              </pre>
              While lambdas care about this specificity, Procs will return nil for any missing arguments, and ignore additional ones. As for return;
              <pre class="ruby">
                def lambda_test
                  lam_test = lambda { return }
                  lam.call
                  puts "This is a test"
                end

                lambda_test
                # => 'This is a test'
              </pre>
              Return inside of a lambda code will set off any code directly outside of the lambda code.
            </p>
            <p>So use this when needed and you'll find that it will be much easier to write simple, clean code!</p>
            <p>Happy Coding!</p>

        <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
          <h2>I'm just a girl.</h2>
          <h4>July 24, 2015</h4>

          <section>
            <p>
              During this year's superbowl, Always ran <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Ep0O5fWN4">this commercial</a> investigating the effects of our words on young girls which thrust me into tears. My husband, sitting next to me, was shocked. How could I, a strong and determined woman, fall to pieces during a two minute advertisement? Well, my toughness and determination is the direct result of years spent fighting comments such as "...like a girl" or "...like a lady" and working hard to prove that I really can do anything you can do. And give me some time, I might do it better.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm incredibly privileged that I didn't let my sex determine my interests or performance. As a child I hated the color pink for the pure reason that girls were 'supposed' to like it, I climbed trees, I played sports, and I was competitive. I was not sugar and spice and everything nice. Most days I was covered in dirt from biking the backwoods I lived near. I still danced and did gymnastics and had a barbie collection, I just didn't like when someone limited me because I didn't have a penis. That is not my fault and everyone has a fifty-fifty chance of getting a penis anyway, so just shut it and let me jump off the side of the house and into the pool, Ma!
            </p>

            <p>
              However, <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html">stereotype threat</a> set in somewhere in my early twenties. I was in a series of abusive relationships and didn't really like who or where I was in life so I made some small steps towards improving my life. I moved to New York City, I began studing Theatre Arts hoping to burst into the theatre scene, and I recognized self-destructive behavior and forged a path to stray from bad patterns. But still, for a few years I felt that my actions were 'typical of a woman', like if I cried or said something unintelligent. I felt that there were things I couldn't or shouldn't do simply because I was a woman. This caused me to limit myself. I spent my childhood proving people wrong and all of a sudden I started acting as if I deserved a limited and painful lot in life because Eve ate that stupid apple.
            </p>
            <p>
              I don't remember when I exited this stage. I don't know if it was sudden or gradual, but I do know that I found that courage and confidence that I had as a child to allow myself to act as I please, regardless of how a 'lady' should be. I started working as an electrician in the theatre and picked up power tools and hauled ladders around. I still feel a hint of stereotype threat when I start a job somewhere in a new theatre and I'm surrounded by men, but once the work begins, I can prove myself with my actions. Plus, I've worked with horrible male theatre technicians. One guy tried to tell me I apologize too much and said he hates how women do that, then he messed up his entire job and DIDN'T APOLOGIZE. I guess I haven't come to any real conclusion except, thanks to social media, I have read numerous articles about women empowerment and it has helped me in the workforce. We are in an age where everything can easily be shared and seen. If stereotype threat is concerning you, read some empowering articles and know that someone else doesn't determine your greatness! So go out there and fight like a girl. A bad-ass girl.

        <h1>Classes in Ruby</h1>
          <h2>When and Why?</h2>
          <h4>July 18, 2015</h4>

          <section>
            <p>
              When I first learned about classes in coding, it was in a course titled Creative Coding. The nature of the course was to learn how to design and animate using code. So we learned how to draw a lot of shapes, then we learned how to animate these shapes by adding 1 to their X and Y coordinates using loops. Using this method was super easy when you just want to make a circle float up the screen, but what if you want to make a game with a series of bubbles that dissapear when you touch them? You can animate each bubble, but that would waste a lot of time, so this is where you would use a class!
            </p>
            <p>
              A class will create an object that can be used over and over. Within the class you can define a series of methods which tell your object what to do. Creating a bubble game can be as simple as this;

              <pre class="ruby">
                class Bubble
                  def float
                    #code that will animate an elipse to rise
                  end

                  def pop
                    #code that will make the bubble disappear when the mouse clicks on the ellipse.
                  end
              </pre>
              After you create a new bubble, you can call all of the methods on the bubble. For example;

              <pre class="ruby">
                bubbleOne = Bubble.new
                bubbleOne.float
                bubbleOne.pop
              </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
              However, there's a huge problem in my example. Ruby is a back-end language. Meaning we would create shapes and animate in a different language altogether. I just wanted to use that example because it made so much sense to me when learning classes. Classes are great when you want a game with tons of bubbles, then you don't have to code out a hundred bubbles, you make a class which acts like a container holding as many bubbles as you will eventually call for, complete with all the behaviors you need. So when would you use classes in Ruby? Anytime you will call an object more than once. Maybe you are buiding a calculator so you would want a math class.

              <pre class="ruby">
                class Calculator
                  def addition (x, y)
                    return x + y
                  end

                  def subtraction (x, y)
                    return x - y
                  end
                end
              </pre>

              You can go on and on with the math methods and now you have built a calculator!
            </p>

        <h1>The Collaborative Workflow and Feedback</h1>
          <h2> How'd I do?</h2>
          <h4>July 18, 2015</h4>

          <section>
            <p>
                Working in a collaborative setting is common in Web Development. There are many benefits, more eyes on the code to check for syntax errors, more minds to brainstorm solutions, and more creative energy adding to the mix. This is not something foreign to me coming from a theatre background. When working on a show as a designer, I am one small part of the larger framework. I feel that my training has prepared me well to pair during coding challenges, but that doesn't mean I don't run into some bumps in the road.
            </p>
            <p>
                Communication is key. While that saying is cliche, it is the truth. If I don't say how I feel, then my pair won't know. If I agree to using code that I don't understand, I'm not really contributing to the work flow. It's hard to communicate. I'm fortunate that I work with kids and can hone my communication skills. Kids take what you say as literal, so over the years I have been able to edit myself in the moment. When I pair on coding challenges, I try to ensure that we have discussed our expectations before we begin. It may help to discuss strengths and weaknesses. You may discover that you have different strengths which will make it easier to challenge yourselves! Communicating can often be difficult, you may have trouble saying what you feel, but take a moment, get your thoughts together, and at least let your pair know you are uncomfortable or confused.
            </p>
            <p>
                Feedback is an amazing beast. Without it, we don't know what to work on, but reading it exposes the weaknesses others see in you, which you may not see in yourself. When I read my feedback, I try to look for common themes. It's obvious that I'm still learning Ruby vocabulary and syntax, so when I see that come up in my feedback, I'm almost relieved that I can see my own weaknesses instead of remaining oblivious. I was definitely nervous the first time I saw a page of my feedback but I reminded myself that I am not even a good programmer, I am a true newbie, and that any feedback is useful because I want to be a great programmer and I need to know what to work on.

            </p>
            <p>
                Writing feedback is an entirely different challenge. I want to be honest and sincere but remain kind. I want to write the kind of useful feedback that I would want to receive. Honestly, the better the partner, the harder the feedback. I find it most difficult to suggest actionable improvement. The harder the pair, the easier the feedback. Which would I rather have? Easier pair, obviously.
            </p>
            <p>
                So think about how you view yourself, and consider reaching out for feedback. Sometimes, I initially cringe and think 'don't tell me what to do', then I think for a minute and come around to the thought, 'yeah, good suggestion.' It's sometimes hard to digest, but know that feedback can and will make you a better programmer, or better anything for that matter!
            </p>
            <p>
                Happy Coding!

        <h1>Looking at a Ruby enumerable</h1>
          <h2>Map it!</h2>
          <h4>July 11, 2015</h4>

          <section>
            <p>
              Using enumerables in Ruby is not only incredibly efficient, it's also super easy! I mean, Ruby was designed to be easier to read, so that's not a surprise.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/Enumerable.html#method-i-map"> map </a> method can be quite useful when you want to modify the objects in an array. Using map, a new array will be returned with the results of running the code in the block once for every element.
            <pre class="ruby">
              array = [1,2,3,4]
              new_array = array.map { |i| i + 1}

              puts array.join(", ")  #=> 1, 2, 3, 4
              puts new_array.join("' ") #=> 2, 3, 4, 5
            </pre>
              The map method will create a new array and complete the modification made in the block on each element of the array.
            </p>
            <p>
              To further break down what is going on;
            <pre class="ruby">
              new_array = array.map { |each element| code to run}
            </pre>
              I hope that clears it up for you!

          <h2> Women in Tech.</h2>
          <h4>July 11, 2015</h4>

          <section>
            <p>
                In 2013, women made up 25% of the workforce in computer occupations. Not surprising, considering that the tech field has been dominated by men. There are many reasons why women are still climbing uphill, not just in the tech field, but in the workforce in general. I'm sure you've heard about the gender wage gap, women earning 78 cents for every dollar a man earns. So there's a lot for women to overcome and, being a woman, I'm happy to be a part of the current shifting of the tides.
            </p>
            <p>
                A simple google search will yield multiple results if you're searching for an organization for women in technology fields. On the popular website <a href="http://www.meetup.com"> Meetup </a> you can find numerous groups just for women. I've attended some wonderful and supportive all-women workshops for Ruby on Rails and Django. In these workshops, it has been refreshing to hear from women currently in the tech community that they shared the same fears I have and that they are now working in supportive and progressive orgnizations.
            </p>
            <p>
                While my experience has been a positive one and the women I have met at events have shared this positive feeling, I can only speak of the community in New York City. When looking at a chart detailing the best cities for women in tech, New York is fifth, with Washington D.C. topping the list. While it's not ideal for women to relocate for employment possibilities, it is a reality for both sexes and not just in tech. Artists flock to major cities all over the country, which is how I found myself in the Big Apple.

            </p>
            <p>
                Women are on the move and we're fighting hard to make our mark, but with major companies like Google and Airbnb on a quest to hire more women, that fight is becomming easier.

        <h1>Arrays and Hashes</h1>
          <h2>Collections in Ruby.</h2>
          <h4>June 30, 2015</h4>

          <section>
            <p>
                Arrays and hashes in Ruby are useful collections of objects or variables that you can easily access when needed. Both are useful though they operate slightly differently. Let's take a look at these differences so you can determine which one is best for your program.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like a virtual filing cabinet where each drawer holds information that you have determined, arrays hold variables, integers, or strings. To initilize an array we call it equal to empty brackets.
                <pre class="ruby">myArray = []</pre>
                This array is empty and waiting for you to fill it with elements.
                <pre class="ruby">myArray = [1, 5.5, "ten"]</pre>
                This array contains an integer, 1, a float, 5.5, and a string, "ten". To access these elements, you call the location number, think of each drawer in your filing cabinet having a number on the door.
                <pre class="ruby">myArray [0]</pre>
                The first element is always 0 so if you have an array of 4 different integers, you have elements 0 through 3.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hashes, on the other hand, will hold exactly what an array can but instead of the doors of your vitual filing cabinet having a predetermined number you must assign each location a label or key.
                <pre class="ruby">myHash = {
                   'strawberry'   =>  'red',
                   'blueberry'    =>  'blue',
                   'banana'       =>  'yellow',
                   'watermelon'   =>  'red'
                   }</pre>
                Here we have mapped fruits based on their color. Now if you call the color red you'll get strawberry and watermelon. This can be useful when dealing with multiple objects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Happy coding!

        <h1>Gregorc Thinking Style</h1>
          <h2>Harnessing the power of your thinking style.</h2>
          <h4>June 30, 2015</h4>

          <section>
            <p>
                What <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html"> thinking style</a> are you? Knowing your thinking style can help you understand how you process information and help you when learning new and challenging material.
            </p>
            <p>
                Concrete Random thinkers, like me, like to experiment to find answers and take risks. We rely on our intuition and like to solve problems independently. This last bit I find to be least helpful when learning. I never did well in study groups and now that I am pair programming a lot, I find myself always thinking that challenges would be easier if I just did them myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Concrete Random thinkers learn best when using trial-and-error approaches and are engaged in some form of competition. Yup. I'm competitive. Even when it comes down to the smallest thing. I've always wanted to prove I'm the best, even when I'm certain I'm not. Perhaps this is a good quality that I can use to ensure my success, but as I've grown older, I have defintely learned how to tame the competitive beast. As for trail-and-error, I can only say that this is a fantastic learning method for any thinker. Benjamin Franklin is quoted as saying "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work." Find those ways that won't work.

            </p>
            <p>
                As for difficulties, Concrete Random thinkers don't like restrictions, formal reports, re-working, keeping detailed records, showing work, choosing one answer, and limited options. Whew. That's a lot to dislike, but some are definitely true for me. For one, I sometimes don't like to show my work because of that whole trial-and-error process. That's a lot of work. Also, I don't always like choosing one answer. I can't even choose one ice cream flavor most times. Thank you inventor of the double scoop. But routines? Bring it. I love a good routine. I'll eat the same thing for breakfast for weeks because routines are easier. Routines are the answer. Maybe routines are my answer to showing my work. BJ Fogg gave a great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdKUJxjn-R8">Ted Talk</a> about tiny habits. Students beginning Dev Bootcamp were encouraged to watch and determine if his method is right for them. I have to say, this was a big key to opening some doors for me. I know that I can't change everything at the same time. But, identifying how my thinking style affects my workflow, I can make tiny changes to my daily habits and work towards success.
            </p>
            <p>
                How? Well, I know that I'm not good at documenting my progress. I can put in place a tiny change, that every 30 minutes I write down the progress I've made. If I've made no progress, then write that. Eventually, I won't feel good about writing 'no progress made' and I'll make some serious progress. Another tiny change, which Dev Bootcamp requires, is to start collaborating with other students more. The more I pair on challenges, the better I'll become at communicating my ideas while remaining respectful and open to collaboration.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, learn your thinking style and consider strategies to help your learning!

                This blog post was inspired by a week long, trial-and-error process figuring out what exactly I was doing when manipulating margins and padding while learning CSS.The diagram in the Chrome Inspect Element tools is a concise visual referrence, but I was still left changing values of either to see if the outcome was the one I desired.

                To put it briefly, the margin is on the outside of the border and the padding is on the inside of the border, inside the padding is the content. So, if I had a block of text, the padding would be the immediate area surrounding the text, followed by a border, if desired, then outside of the border would be the margin. This is useful to know because padding basically becomes a part of your content. So, if you are lining up columns, margins will expand the box model, that visual I mentioned above, but will not expand the content.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's also helpful to remember when using padding that the values you choose add to the total value of your content. If you have content that is 100 pixels wide and padding on the right and left of 20 pixels, the total width of your content is 140 pixels wide!

           <h4>“These are my nine weeks! Get out of my way!”</h4>
            <p>
              After watching the Fireside Chat with Dev Bootcamp co-founder Shereef Bishay, many of my thoughts on this journey were confirmed. I control my destiny. I will get out what I put in. I am not an imposter. My impression of DBC when I visited the NYC site was that the 19 weeks will be challenging. There is a vast amount of information and the expectations are high, as they should be. I knew that juggling the program with the rest of my responsibilities would be difficult and I expected to spend any free time I had learning something new or solidifying a previous lesson, which is exactly what has happened during my very first week. My weekends are now precious time to sit at my desk for hours, working on challenges, googling solutions, and celebrating some serious tiny successes.
            </p>
          <h4>“If you can’t expose your ignorance, you won’t learn.”</h4>
            <p>
              DBC is passionate about Empathetic Engineering and so am I. This was high on my list of attractive traits when applying to DBC. I am ignorant. I do not know a lot about computers or coding and I am happy to admit that. I am happy that DBC fosters an environment where saying I don’t know is a great and necessary thing. I feel like I will thrive at DBC. I love learning and I love teaching others. I feel that working on projects rather than sitting at a desk all day is much more beneficial for a student. As a student, I hope to learn from others in my cohort, I hope to teach someone in my cohort, and I hope to write some beautiful code to make some beautiful things. My expectations of DBC have not changed now that I have begun. I set my own bar high, they set the bar high, so now I’m doing my best to stay up here at this high bar.
            </p>
         <h4>“Intelligence, as we think about it, is overrated”</h4>
            <p>
              I am beyond excited to participate in DBC’s learning environment. Full disclosure; I had tears in my eyes after my interview. I was humbled. I thought I was beyond prepared and I was hit with a logic question that I did not answer. In fact, I didn’t get a lot of questions right, but I remained dedicated to finding an answer, I remained positive even when I ran out of time and I showed my ignorance. I asked for help. I was vulnerable. I am vulnerable. I was never the smartest in my class and I don’t need to be. I am not nervous about learning at DBC, I am excited and I know that I am as prepared as I can be. I know that being prepared does not mean I will not fail. Being prepared means I will learn from my failures.

        <h1>Git and GitHub</h1>
          <h2>What is it and why should you use it?</h2>
          <h4>June 14, 2015</h4>

              Git is a version control software that helps developers keep track of changes made to their code. Git is installed on your computer and uses various commands to help developers implement a more efficient workflow. You may be asking <i>What is version control?</i> Version control allows developers the chance to better collaborate and to save work in stages. Remember back to high school or college when you had to write a paper. If you simply hit 'save' you were left with just the updated edits to your paper. Maybe you used 'save as' and created new files of each iteration, using the date to distignuish one from the next. Git does this for you by using commits! Everytime you edit and commit a file, git stores a snapshot of the updated file. If the changes you made don't work, simply return to a previous commit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now imagine you were collaborating on this paper with a classmate and you each decided to write the opening paragaph and see which one best suits the needs of the paper. This is where GitHub comes in. GitHub is a website where you can upload and download files to collaborate with other developers. Since git and your files live locally on your own computer, GitHub allows you to push your files to a website where others can view your work and contribute to your project. This is quite helpful if you were working on this paper with the whole class, don't you think?
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, imagine you were assigned to collaborate with your class on a paper for every class in which you were enrolled. That sounds like a recipe for a mess. Not with GitHub! You can seperate your projects into different repositories, or directories, where multiple files can live. This way, anyone you are collaborating with can pull those files and work only on that project. GitHub opens up a world of potential, so check it out!
